    "ai_response": "Based on your electricity usage analysis and to help you save energy, here are three actionable tips:\n\n1.  **Optimize Bedroom Air Conditioner Usage:** Given that your Bedroom Air Conditioner is your highest power consumer, consider increasing its thermostat setting by a few degrees (e.g., from 22°C to 24°C). Even a small change can significantly reduce energy consumption. Also, utilize the \"Fan\" mode when the room is cool enough to maintain comfort with less energy.\n2.  **Combine AC with Bedroom Ceiling Fan:** You are already using both, which is good. Ensure your Bedroom Ceiling Fan is on when the AC is running. This helps circulate cool air more effectively, allowing you to set the AC to a higher temperature without sacrificing comfort, thus reducing AC run time and energy usage.\n3.  **Manage Desktop Computer Idle Time:** Your Desktop Computer is a notable consumer. Implement power-saving settings on your computer to automatically enter sleep mode after a period of inactivity. When not in use for extended periods, consider turning it off completely rather than leaving it in standby, as even standby modes consume energy.",

    "ai_response": "Here's a detailed analysis of your electricity usage:\n\n**Overall Usage Summary:**\n\n*   **Total Energy Consumed (Historical):** Approximately 411.46 kWh\n*   **Estimated Total Cost (for 411.46 kWh):** ₹2241.66\n*   **Your Monthly Budget:** ₹2500\n\n**Top Power Consumers:**\n\n1.  **Bedroom Air Conditioner:** Approximately 181.92 kWh\n    *   This is by far your highest energy consumer, accounting for a significant portion of your total usage.\n2.  **Desktop Computer:** Approximately 95.60 kWh\n    *   Your desktop computer is the second most significant energy user.\n3.  **Smart Switch Hub:** Approximately 67.80 kWh\n    *   This appliance also contributes considerably to your overall usage, potentially due to multiple devices connected or continuous operation.\n4.  **Bedroom Ceiling Fan:** Approximately 45.35 kWh\n5.  **Bedroom Main Light:** Approximately 12.33 kWh\n6.  **Study Table Lamp:** Approximately 8.45 kWh\n\n**Usage Patterns from Logs:**\n\nYour usage logs indicate consistent operation, especially for the Bedroom Air Conditioner and Bedroom Ceiling Fan, which show long durations of use, often extending overnight or for several hours daily. The Desktop Computer also demonstrates regular usage. The Smart Switch Hub's high total usage suggests it's either continuously active or manages several frequently used devices.\n\n**Key Observations & Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Bedroom Air Conditioner Dominance:** The Air Conditioner is the primary driver of your electricity consumption. Optimizing its use will yield the most significant impact on reducing your bill.\n*   **Desktop Computer Usage:** While less than the AC, your Desktop Computer is a substantial individual consumer. Managing its usage can lead to noticeable savings.\n*   **Smart Switch Hub Efficiency:** The high total usage for the Smart Switch Hub indicates that devices connected to it are frequently active. Identifying and managing these connected devices could offer further savings.\n*   **Budget Adherence:** Based on your historical usage, your estimated cost of ₹2241.66 is currently within your ₹2500 monthly budget. However, consistent high usage from your top consumers can quickly lead to exceeding this budget, especially during peak seasons or with increased appliance use.\n\n**Actionable Tips for Energy Saving:**\n\n1.  **Optimize Bedroom Air Conditioner Settings:** Given its high consumption, consider setting your Bedroom Air Conditioner to a slightly higher, yet comfortable, temperature (e.g., 24-26°C) and utilize the \"dry\" or \"fan\" mode when appropriate. Regularly cleaning or replacing its air filters can also improve efficiency.\n2.  **Smart Power Management for Desktop Computer:** Implement power-saving settings on your Desktop Computer to automatically enter sleep mode after a shorter period of inactivity (e.g., 15-30 minutes). For longer breaks or overnight, make it a habit to turn it off completely rather than leaving it in standby.\n3.  **Audit and Automate Smart Switch Hub Devices:** Review all appliances connected to your Smart Switch Hub. For non-essential devices, create smart routines to automatically turn them off when not in use or during specific off-peak hours. This helps eliminate \"phantom load\" and reduces the hub's overall energy footprint.",

The `Smart Switch Hub` also shows significant consumption, suggesting continuous operation or a number of connected devices drawing power. Your `Desktop Computer` has moderate usage. Other appliances like the `Bedroom Ceiling Fan`, `Bedroom Main Light`, and `Study Table Lamp` contribute much less to your overall consumption.\n\n**Key Observations & Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Air Conditioner Optimization is Crucial:** The Bedroom Air Conditioner's usage of over 100 kWh makes it the primary target for energy saving. Implementing smart routines or manual adjustments to its temperature and operating hours will have the most significant impact on your bill.\n*   **Smart Switch Hub Review:** The Smart Switch Hub's relatively high consumption suggests there might be devices connected to it that are constantly drawing power, even when not actively in use. Reviewing and automating the power-off schedules for these connected devices could lead to savings.\n*   **Desktop Computer Power Management:** While less than the AC, your Desktop Computer is still a notable consumer. Ensuring it enters sleep mode or is fully shut down when not in use can contribute to reducing consumption.\n\nTo help you further, I recommend focusing on optimizing the usage of your Bedroom Air Conditioner and reviewing the devices connected to your Smart Switch Hub.",
