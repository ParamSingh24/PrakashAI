    "reasoning": "I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the smart home system data, including existing routines, appliance usage patterns, and user preferences from chat history.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   The user has a strong interest in energy saving, and their current energy consumption is projected to exceed their budget.\n*   The Bedroom Air Conditioner, Smart Switch Hub, and Desktop Computer are the top energy consumers.\n*   Previous AI suggestions included increasing AC temperature, turning off the Smart Switch Hub during extended inactivity (e.g., while at work), and ensuring a full shutdown of the Desktop Computer.\n*   Several autonomous routines are already in place, primarily focusing on turning off high-consumption appliances during late-night or weekday hours.\n\n**Autonomous Action Taken:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I identified an opportunity to further optimize energy consumption related to the Smart Switch Hub. While a routine existed to turn it off at night, there was no routine to manage its power during weekday daytime hours when the user is likely out. This directly addresses a previous AI suggestion to power off non-essential devices connected to the hub during extended periods of inactivity.\n\nI have created a new autonomous routine:\n\n*   **Routine Name:** \"Weekday Smart Switch Hub Off\"\n*   **Description:** Turns off the Smart Switch Hub during weekday daytime hours (9 AM) to prevent phantom load and save energy, assuming it's not in active use.\n*   **Schedule:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at 09:00\n*   **Action:** Turn off appliance `switch1` (Smart Switch Hub)\n*   **Reasoning:** The Smart Switch Hub is the second highest energy consumer. This routine aims to reduce its energy consumption and phantom load during weekday daytime hours when the user is likely out, aligning with the user's energy-saving interest and addressing the budget concern. This complements the existing \"Nighttime Smart Switch Hub Off\" and \"Weekday Living Room Lamp Off\" routines.\n\n**Further Considerations (Limitations with current tools):**\n\n*   **AC Temperature Adjustment:** While a previous AI suggestion recommended increasing the AC temperature by 2-3 degrees for energy saving, the current tools do not support setting specific temperature values for appliances.\n*   **Fine-tuning AC Off/On Times:** Optimizing AC turn-off 30-60 minutes before leaving or waking requires more precise user schedule data than currently available.\n\nThis autonomous action is designed to improve energy efficiency and contribute to the user's comfort by reducing unnecessary power consumption, aligning with the core directives of EcosyncAutonomous.",

I have identified key patterns and implemented two new routines to enhance energy efficiency and user comfort:\n\n1.  **Late Night Fan On**: A routine has been created to turn on the \"Bedroom Ceiling Fan\" (fan1) at 2:00 AM every day. This will provide continued comfort after the \"Bedroom Air Conditioner\" (ac1) automatically turns off at 2:00 AM, while significantly reducing energy consumption. This aligns with the user's interest in energy saving and the AI's suggestion to utilize the fan during milder periods.\n\n2.  **Nighttime Smart Switch Hub Off**: A routine has been established to turn off the \"Smart Switch Hub\" (switch1) at 1:30 AM every day. This action directly addresses the \"phantom load\" identified for this appliance, preventing unnecessary energy consumption during inactive hours. This is in line with the user's energy-saving preferences and the AI's proactive recommendations.\n\nThese actions are based on a comprehensive analysis of home data, energy usage patterns, and user preferences, ensuring they are beneficial, safe, and aligned with the user's desired smart home experience.",

I have identified key areas for energy savings and user comfort improvement based on the comprehensive home data.\n\nHere's a summary of the autonomous actions taken:\n\n1.  **Created \"Early Morning AC Off\" Routine:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Bedroom Air Conditioner is the top energy consumer, and AI insights suggested turning it off 30-60 minutes before the user typically wakes up. This routine turns off the AC at 5:30 AM daily, saving 30 minutes of AC usage while leveraging residual coolness to maintain comfort before the user's likely wake-up time. This aligns with the user's energy-saving interest and complements the existing \"Early Morning AC On\" routine.\n    *   **Impact:** Reduces AC runtime and energy consumption.\n\n2.  **Created \"Nighttime Living Room Lamp Off\" Routine:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The \"Smart Living Room Lamp\" showed a high power usage per hour (12 KWh) but no recorded usage, indicating a potential phantom load or accidental leaving on. This routine ensures the lamp is turned off daily at 11:00 PM, preventing unnecessary energy consumption during typical non-usage hours.\n    *   **Impact:** Eliminates potential phantom load and saves energy.\n\n3.  **Created \"Nighttime Bedroom Light Off\" Routine:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** To further optimize energy efficiency, this routine turns off the \"Bedroom Main Light\" at 11:30 PM daily. This prevents accidental leaving on and contributes to overall energy savings during typical sleep hours, aligning with the user's energy-saving interest.\n    *   **Impact:** Reduces energy waste from accidental light usage.\n\nThese actions prioritize energy efficiency and aim to reduce the projected cost, while carefully considering user comfort and existing preferences. I have focused on reducing appliance runtimes and eliminating potential phantom loads, aligning with the autonomous directives and decision framework.",

    "reasoning": "EcosyncAutonomous has completed its comprehensive analysis and autonomous optimization.\n\n**Summary of Actions Taken:**\n\n1.  **Resolved Conflicting AC Routines:** The \"Early Morning AC Off\" routine (scheduled for 5:30 AM) was found to be in direct conflict with the \"Early Morning AC On\" routine (scheduled for 5:00 AM). This conflict could lead to inefficient operation and potentially compromise user comfort. To rectify this, the \"Early Morning AC Off\" routine (`auto_routine_1756929425007`) has been **deleted**. This ensures the Bedroom Air Conditioner operates for a more reasonable duration to achieve the user's preferred temperature of 24°C before they wake up.\n\n2.  **Implemented AC and Fan Synergy:** To enhance cooling efficiency and user comfort while promoting energy savings, a new routine named \"Early Morning Fan On with AC\" has been **created**. This routine will automatically turn on the Bedroom Ceiling Fan (`fan1`) at 5:00 AM, precisely when the Bedroom Air Conditioner (`ac1`) is scheduled to turn on. This action aligns with the AI's proactive suggestions to use the fan in conjunction with the AC, allowing for better air circulation and potentially enabling the AC to maintain comfort at a slightly higher, more energy-efficient temperature.\n\n**Reasoning for Actions:**\n\nThese autonomous actions were taken based on the following data-driven insights and directives:\n\n*   **Energy Budget Exceedance:** The user's projected cost of ₹3255.46 significantly exceeds their monthly budget of ₹2500, with the Bedroom Air Conditioner identified as the top energy consumer.\n*   **User Preferences:** The user has explicitly indicated `energySavingInterest: True` and a preferred `temperature: 24`.\n*   **AI Insights and Suggestions:** The system's AI insights highlighted the importance of using the fan with the AC to reduce the AC's power draw and suggested creating routines to optimize AC usage.\n*   **Routine Conflict Resolution:** The contradictory nature of the two early morning AC routines was identified as an inefficiency that needed immediate correction to ensure consistent comfort and energy management.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n\n*   **Improved User Comfort:** By allowing the AC to run for a longer, uninterrupted period in the morning, the system can more effectively reach and maintain the user's preferred temperature.\n*   **Enhanced Energy Efficiency:** The synergy between the AC and the ceiling fan will help cool the room more efficiently, potentially reducing the overall runtime or intensity required from the AC, leading to energy savings.\n*   **Progress Towards Budget Adherence:** By optimizing the usage of the highest energy-consuming appliance, these actions contribute to bringing the overall energy consumption closer to the user's monthly budget.\n\nEcosyncAutonomous will continue to monitor usage patterns and system data to identify further optimization opportunities, always prioritizing user safety, comfort, and energy efficiency.",

This aims to significantly reduce power consumption during typical work hours when the user is likely out, aligning with energy-saving interests and budget management.\n\n2.  **Created \"Weekday Living Room Lamp Off\" Routine:** The Smart Living Room Lamp (app_1756921986994_kzpqogt3mlg) was identified as having high power usage per hour but no recorded usage, indicating potential phantom load or accidental leaving on. To mitigate this, I have created a routine to **turn off the Smart Living Room Lamp at 09:00 AM every weekday (Monday-Friday)**. This ensures it is off during typical weekday daytime hours when not in active use, aligning with energy-saving interests.\n\n**Action Not Taken (and Reasoning):**\n\n*   **Desktop Computer Power Off:** I attempted to create a routine to turn off the Desktop Computer (pc1) at 10:00 PM daily to eliminate phantom load earlier. However, a similar autonomous routine named \"Nighttime PC Power Off\" already exists, which turns off the Desktop Computer at 01:00 AM daily. To avoid redundancy and potential conflicts, I did not create a new routine for the Desktop Computer. The existing routine will continue to manage its power off.\n\nThese actions are designed to proactively optimize energy efficiency and contribute to staying within the monthly budget, while aligning with your expressed interest in energy savings and maintaining user comfort. I will continue to monitor usage patterns and system data for further optimization opportunities.",

    "reasoning": "I have completed a comprehensive analysis of your smart home system, taking into account all available data including appliance usage, existing routines, and your expressed preferences for energy saving.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   Your projected monthly electricity cost of ₹3255.46 significantly exceeds your budget of ₹2500, indicating a need for further optimization.\n*   The Bedroom Air Conditioner (ac1) remains the highest energy consumer, contributing significantly to the budget overrun.\n*   You have a high interest in energy saving, and several proactive AI suggestions from past interactions align with reducing AC usage and managing phantom loads.\n*   Existing autonomous routines are already in place to manage various appliances during typical non-usage hours.\n\n**Autonomous Actions Taken:**\nTo address the high energy consumption of the Bedroom Air Conditioner and align with your energy-saving preferences, I have modified two existing routines:\n\n1.  **Modified \"Late Night AC Off\" Routine:**\n    *   **Previous Schedule:** Turns off the Bedroom Air Conditioner at 02:00 daily.\n    *   **New Schedule:** The Bedroom Air Conditioner will now turn off at **01:30** daily.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This modification extends the period during which the AC is off by 30 minutes during deep sleep hours. This aims to further reduce the Bedroom Air Conditioner's power consumption, directly contributing to energy savings and helping to bring your electricity bill closer to your budget, while minimizing impact on comfort as you are likely in deep sleep.\n\n2.  **Modified \"Late Night Fan On\" Routine:**\n    *   **Previous Schedule:** Turns on the Bedroom Ceiling Fan at 02:00 daily.\n    *   **New Schedule:** The Bedroom Ceiling Fan will now turn on at **01:30** daily.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This modification synchronizes the fan's activation with the earlier turn-off of the Bedroom Air Conditioner. By turning on the ceiling fan at 01:30, it ensures continuous air circulation and maintains comfort during the extended AC-off period, further supporting energy efficiency as per AI suggestions for AC and fan synergy.\n\nThese actions are designed to reduce energy consumption from your highest-consuming appliance while maintaining a balance with your comfort preferences. I will continue to monitor usage patterns and identify further optimization opportunities.",

By turning off the high-consuming AC later than the previous routine and immediately activating the low-power fan, it aligns with AI suggestions for AC and fan synergy to maintain a comfortable environment while reducing overall energy consumption.\n\n2.  **Nighttime Study Lamp Off:**\n    *   Created a new routine named \"Nighttime Study Lamp Off.\" This routine will turn off the \"Study Table Lamp\" (lamp1) at **11:00 PM daily**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This ensures the Study Table Lamp is not left on unnecessarily during typical non-usage hours, preventing minor energy wastage and contributing to overall home energy efficiency, aligning with general energy-saving practices.\n\n3.  **Refined Nighttime PC Power Off:**\n    *   Modified the existing \"Nighttime PC Power Off\" routine to execute at **11:30 PM daily**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This change aligns the PC shutdown time with typical user sleep hours, as suggested by AI insights, to further reduce phantom load and save energy from the \"Desktop Computer\" (pc1), which is a significant energy consumer.\n\nThese autonomous actions are based on a comprehensive analysis of home data, energy usage patterns, and user preferences from chat history, prioritizing energy savings and user comfort.",

This immediate action prevents unnecessary energy consumption.\n2.  **Created a new routine: \"Weekday Morning Fan Off\":** This routine will turn off the Bedroom Ceiling Fan (fan1) at 09:00 AM on weekdays. This addresses the previous lack of a turn-off routine for the fan, which was being activated in the early morning. This will prevent the fan from running unnecessarily when the user is likely out of the bedroom, contributing to energy savings.\n\nThese actions are based on a comprehensive analysis of your home data, prioritize energy efficiency and user comfort, and align with your stated preferences and budget goals.",

I have taken the following actions:\n\n1.  **Deleted Invalid Routines:** Removed \"Nighttime Living Room Lamp Off\" and \"Weekday Living Room Lamp Off\" as they were associated with a non-existent appliance, streamlining the routine management.\n2.  **Optimized Study Table Lamp Usage:** Turned off the \"Study Table Lamp\" (lamp1) which was found to be unnecessarily on past its scheduled off-time, contributing to immediate energy savings.\n3.  **Created Proactive TV Power-Off Routine:** Established a \"Goodnight TV Off\" routine to automatically turn off the \"Television\" (XEWFE) daily at 11:00 PM. This proactively addresses potential phantom load and aligns with user preferences for reducing energy waste, even though the TV currently shows no usage.\n\nThese actions were taken based on a comprehensive analysis of home data, user preferences, and energy consumption patterns, prioritizing energy efficiency and user comfort while adhering to the autonomous operation rules.",

    "reasoning": "The smart home system has undergone a comprehensive autonomous analysis to optimize efficiency and user comfort.\n\n**Key Findings from Analysis:**\n\n*   The user, Krishna Singh, has a high interest in energy saving and is currently projected to exceed their monthly budget.\n*   The Bedroom Air Conditioner (ac1) is the highest energy consumer, followed by the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE) and the Desktop Computer (pc1).\n*   Existing autonomous routines are already in place to manage these top consumers, including:\n    *   Nighttime power-off routines for the PC, bedroom light, study lamp, and smart switch hub/TV.\n    *   Weekday power-off routines for the AC, smart switch hub, and bedroom fan during typical work hours.\n    *   An \"Optimized Nighttime Cooling\" routine that turns off the AC and turns on the fan during deep sleep hours (03:00 AM) to balance comfort and energy saving.\n    *   \"Early Morning AC On\" and \"Early Morning Fan On with AC\" routines to ensure comfort before the user wakes up.\n*   User preferences and AI suggestions from chat history consistently highlight the need for AC optimization (e.g., temperature settings, using fan with AC, pre-cooling) and reducing phantom loads from devices connected to the smart switch hub.\n\n**Autonomous Actions Taken:**\n\n1.  **Redundant Routine Deletion:** It was identified that two routines were scheduled to turn off the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE): \"Goodnight TV Off\" at 23:00 daily and \"Nighttime Smart Switch Hub Off\" at 01:30 daily. To streamline routine management and ensure earlier energy saving, the redundant \"Nighttime Smart Switch Hub Off\" routine (ID: `auto_routine_1756928743892`) was deleted. The \"Goodnight TV Off\" routine now solely manages the nightly power-off of the Smart Switch Hub.\n\n**Current Optimization Status:**\n\nThe smart home system is currently well-optimized with a comprehensive set of autonomous routines designed to reduce energy consumption and enhance user comfort, especially for the highest energy-consuming appliances. The deletion of the redundant routine further refines the system's efficiency.\n\n**Further Optimization Opportunities (Requires Enhanced Capabilities):**\n\nWhile the system is optimized within the current tool capabilities, further enhancements could be achieved with:\n\n*   **Temperature Control for AC:** The ability to set specific temperatures (e.g., 24-26°C as per user preference) for the Bedroom Air Conditioner would allow for more granular comfort and energy management, including implementing \"sleep mode\" or gradual temperature increases.\n*   **Sub-Device Control for Smart Switch Hub:** The capacity to identify and control individual devices connected to the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE) would enable more targeted energy-saving routines, addressing \"vampire loads\" from specific non-essential electronics.\n*   **More Granular Usage Data:** Access to real-time or more detailed historical usage data for specific times of the day could reveal additional subtle patterns for optimization.\n\nThe system will continue to operate autonomously, learning from patterns and making intelligent decisions to maintain an optimized home environment.",

I have identified an opportunity to further reduce energy consumption related to the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE), which is the second highest energy consumer in your home.\n\n**Action Taken:**\nI have created a new autonomous routine called \"Weekend Daytime Smart Switch Hub Off\".\n\n**Routine Details:**\n*   **Name:** Weekend Daytime Smart Switch Hub Off\n*   **Schedule:** Every Saturday and Sunday at 09:00\n*   **Action:** Turns off the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE)\n*   **Reasoning:** The Smart Switch Hub is a significant energy consumer, and you have expressed a strong interest in energy saving, with a projected budget overrun. While there are existing routines for weekdays and late nights, this new routine ensures the Smart Switch Hub and its connected devices are turned off during typical non-usage hours on weekends, further reducing phantom load and unnecessary energy consumption. This aligns with previous AI suggestions to power off non-essential devices during extended periods of inactivity, contributing to overall energy efficiency and helping you stay within your budget.\n\nThis action is designed to enhance energy efficiency and align with your preferences for a seamlessly optimized smart home experience.",

    "reasoning": "I have completed the autonomous analysis and optimization of your smart home system.\n\nHere's a summary of the actions taken:\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** I analyzed all available data, including appliance usage logs, existing routines, and your chat history to understand energy consumption patterns, user preferences, and optimization opportunities. I noted your high interest in energy saving and that your projected energy costs are exceeding your budget.\n\n2.  **Identified Optimization Opportunities:** The Bedroom Air Conditioner (`ac1`) and the Smart Switch Hub (`XEWFE`, sometimes referred to as 'switch1') were identified as the top energy consumers. Your preferences indicated a desire to use the ceiling fan in conjunction with the AC for better efficiency and to turn off non-essential devices to reduce phantom load.\n\n3.  **Created a New Energy-Saving Routine:** To further optimize energy usage and align with your preferences, I created a new routine:\n    *   **Routine Name:** \"Weekend Daytime AC Off with Fan On\"\n    *   **Schedule:** Every Saturday and Sunday at 09:00\n    *   **Actions:** Turns off the \"Bedroom Air Conditioner\" (`ac1`) and turns on the \"Bedroom Ceiling Fan\" (`fan1`).\n    *   **Reasoning:** This routine aims to reduce the high energy consumption of the Air Conditioner during weekend daytime hours when you might be out or can maintain comfort with just the fan. This aligns with your energy-saving goals and the AI's suggestion to use the fan and AC in synergy.\n\nThis new routine complements the existing weekday AC and fan routines, ensuring consistent energy-saving practices across the entire week. I have also reviewed the existing \"Goodnight TV Off\" routine and confirmed its intent to power off the Smart Switch Hub (XEWFE) and its connected devices, including the Television, to prevent phantom load.\n\nI will continue to monitor your home's data and proactively identify further opportunities for optimization to enhance efficiency and comfort.",
