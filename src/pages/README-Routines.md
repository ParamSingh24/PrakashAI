## Usage

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import Routines from './pages/Routines';

// The component automatically fetches data and handles all interactions
<Routines />
```

### AI Assistant Usage
1. Click "AI Assistant" button
2. Describe routine in natural language
3. AI generates routine configuration
4. Review and create routine

### Manual Creation Usage
1. Click "Add New Routine" button
2. Fill in routine details (name, description, schedule)
3. Select target appliance and action
4. Choose execution days
5. Create routine

## AI Integration Features

### Natural Language Processing
- **Input Examples**:
  - "Turn off fan at 11 PM every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday"
  - "Turn on kitchen fan at 5 PM daily"
  - "Turn off bathroom AC for power saving at 10 PM"

### Smart Suggestions
- AI analyzes user patterns and suggests useful routines
- Provides energy-saving routine recommendations
- Offers routine optimization suggestions

## Routine Management Features

### Filtering Options
- **All Routines**: View all created routines
- **Active**: Only active/running routines
- **Inactive**: Only paused/stopped routines
- **AI Created**: Routines generated by AI
- **Manual**: Routines created manually

### Routine Actions
